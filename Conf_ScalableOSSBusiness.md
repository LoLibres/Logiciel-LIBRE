# Building a scalable OSS Based Business



Le business open source est différent d'un business régulier car les utilisateurs sont déjà existants. L'objectif est de permettre l'utilisation en production d'un outil viable tout en créant un besoin qui va au dela du modèle gratuit et pour lequel l'utilisateur sera prêt à payer.

## Business Model
#### Open core
-> sell enterprise license/ integration. Disrupted by the cloud.
#### Saas / cloud
-> upgrade in saas/ stickiness in open source. Is this still open source ?
#### Services
-> support and consulting. Bounded by people.
Easiest way to start.

How to convert users
Amount the download, few will use in production and even fewer will buy.

Differences with regular business. People will download deploy and test.

They are used to it and need more options -> pay.

Communications by evangelists, puis propagation.
